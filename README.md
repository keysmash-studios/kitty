This is a simple webserver, it does allow you to host other services, that is, you can't host wordpress on it.

However, you can host static web technologies, and overall make a static HTTP server.

History of the name
-------------------

It's quite simple funny enough, when "learning" about webservers in IT class we were being told to use WampServer to host a Wordpress site.

I then questioned "Why don't you just use caddy", I then got told "Kitty, name our own, and name it kitty"

Thanks Caddy for the inspiration to our name.
