Another cool thing along with this would be to have a way to hide certain files from the file listings...\n\nPerhaps have a \"hide_files\", \"show_files\", \"block_files\" and \"allow_files\"\n\n - hide_files\n   - this would hide files in the file listings\n - show_files\n   - this would show only certain files in the file listings\n - block_files\n   - this would block you from requesting the file\n - allow_files\n   - this would allow you to request only certain files\n\nOf course all of these would be with an array of regExp matching like what \"no_filelistings\" already has. However handling what would happen if you use both the selective and unselective one would be a weird story...","files":null}]}
