So that needs to be fixed.\n\nHowever a way to disable downloads is still very possible and a feature I'll look into, it isn't so much disabling downloads and rather just disabling requesting certain paths/files, but that almost makes it sounds like that might've bigger consequences such as not being able to load resources from the website, regardless I'll have to look into it.","files":null}]}
