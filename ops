But preferably use some hash library, give the user the ability to generate their hashes, and choose the hash algorithm, (SHA128/256/512, MD5 etc) or just plaintext.\n\nPreferably set it up like a htpasswd, (`user:password`) where `password` is the hashed or plaintext password, then you tell the config to use a certain hash algorithm, and it'll then convert it when checking the passwords.","files":null}]}
